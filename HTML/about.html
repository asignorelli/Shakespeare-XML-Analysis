      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p class="dropcap">
        This project explores the neologisms coined by William Shakespeare throughout his literary works.
        Neologisms are newly invented words or phrases that often reflect the cultural and societal changes
        of their time. Shakespeare is renowned for his inventive use of language, and many of the words he
        created have become an integral part of the English lexicon.

      <h2>Methodology</h2>

      <div class="method-grid">

        <p>
          Throughout this project, we examined the full corpus of Shakespeare's works, including all plays
          and sonnets. These were formatted as XML files, and our team developed a multi-step process to
          analyze the text. We first obtained a list of Shakespeare's invented words from:
          <a href="http://elizabethandrama.org/shakespeare-invented-words-project/master-list-invented-words/">
            Elizabethan Drama – Invented Words
          </a>.
          Using this list, we generated an XSLT transformation that marks each instance of a matching word in
          the corpus. This provided us with a comprehensive dataset of Shakespearean neologisms.
