      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p class="dropcap">
        This project explores the neologisms coined by William Shakespeare throughout his literary works.
        Neologisms are newly invented words or phrases that often reflect the cultural and societal changes
        of their time. Shakespeare is renowned for his inventive use of language, and many of the words he
        created have become an integral part of the English lexicon.

      <h2>Research Questions</h2>
      <div class="method-grid">
      <!-- Left column: description -->
      <p>Our main research questions we are answering are:<br/>
      - How has Shakespeare's use of Neologisms influenced his works?<br/>
      - How are these neologisms spread across his entire corpus<br/></p>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>

      <div class="method-grid">

        <p>
          Throughout this project, we examined the full corpus of Shakespeare's works, including all plays
          and sonnets. These were formatted as XML files, and our team developed a multi-step process to
          analyze the text. We first obtained a list of Shakespeare's invented words (neologisms) from:
          <a href="http://elizabethandrama.org/shakespeare-invented-words-project/master-list-invented-words/">
            Elizabethan Drama – Invented Words
          </a>.
          Using this list, we generated an XSLT transformation that looped across the collection of the corpus and gave markup to each neologism across the entire corpus. Using these neologisms, we were able to extract data in the form of counts and frequency for the neologisms. This data, combined with a list of every neologism and its definition and part of speech was used to provide the input for our charts. Now, we used XSLT to help with the production of this webpage, including generating each play page, word page, and all of the charts associated with them.
