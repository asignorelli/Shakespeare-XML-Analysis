               <br/> Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief
                    ,<br/> And by these badges understand the King :<br/> For your fair sakes have
                    we neglected time ,<br/> Played foul play with our oaths . Your beauty , ladies
                    ,<br/> Hath much deformed us , fashioning our humors<br/> Even to the
                    opposèd end of our intents .<br/> And what in us hath seemed ridiculous
                    —<br/> As love is full of unbefitting strains ,<br/> All wanton as a
                    child , skipping and vain ,<br/> Formed by the eye and therefore , like the eye
                    ,<br/> Full of strange shapes , of habits , and of forms ,<br/> Varying in
                    subjects as the eye doth roll<br/> To every varied object in his glance ;<br/>
                    Which <span class="neologism">parti-coated</span> presence of loose love<br/>
                    Put on by us , if , in your heavenly eyes ,<br/> Have misbecomed our oaths and
                    gravities ,<br/> Those heavenly eyes , that look into these faults ,<br/>
                    Suggested us to make . Therefore , ladies ,<br/> Our love being yours , the
                    error that love makes<br/> Is likewise yours . We to ourselves prove
                    false<br/> By being once false forever to be true<br/> To those that make us
                    both — fair ladies , you .<br/> And even that falsehood , in itself a sin
                    ,<br/> Thus purifies itself and turns to grace .</p>
