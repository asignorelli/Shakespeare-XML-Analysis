               <br/> My duty to you both , on equal love ,<br/> Great
                    kings of France and England . That I have<br/> labored<br/> With all my wits ,
                    my pains , and strong endeavors<br/> To bring your most imperial
                    Majesties<br/> Unto this bar and royal interview ,<br/> Your Mightiness on
                    both parts best can witness .<br/> Since , then , my office hath so far
                    prevailed<br/> That face to face and royal eye to eye<br/> You have congreeted
                    , let it not disgrace me<br/> If I demand before this royal view<br/> What rub
                    or what impediment there is<br/> Why that the naked , poor , and mangled peace
                    ,<br/> Dear nurse of arts , plenties , and joyful births ,<br/> Should not in
                    this best garden of the world ,<br/> Our fertile France , put up her lovely
                    visage ?<br/> Alas , she hath from France too long been chased ,<br/> And all
                    her husbandry doth lie on heaps ,<br/> Corrupting in its own fertility .<br/>
                    Her vine , the merry cheerer of the heart ,<br/> Unprunèd , dies . Her
                    hedges , even-pleached ,<br/> Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair ,<br/>
                    Put forth disordered twigs . Her fallow leas<br/> The darnel , hemlock , and
                    rank fumitory<br/> Doth root upon , while that the coulter rusts<br/> That
                    should <span class="neologism">deracinate</span> such <span class="neologism">savagery</span> .<br/> The even mead , that erst brought sweetly
                    forth<br/> The freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover ,<br/> Wanting the
                    scythe , withal uncorrected , rank ,<br/> Conceives by idleness , and nothing
                    teems<br/> But hateful docks , rough thistles , kecksies , burrs ,<br/> Losing
                    both beauty and utility .<br/> And all our vineyards , fallows , meads , and
                    hedges ,<br/> Defective in their natures , grow to wildness .<br/> Even so our
                    houses and ourselves and children<br/> Have lost , or do not learn for want of
                    time ,<br/> The sciences that should become our country ,<br/> But grow like
                    savages , as soldiers will<br/> That nothing do but meditate on blood ,<br/>
                    To swearing and stern looks , diffused attire ,<br/> And everything that seems
                    unnatural .<br/> Which to reduce into our former favor<br/> You are assembled
                    , and my speech entreats<br/> That I may know the let why gentle peace<br/>
                    Should not expel these inconveniences<br/> And bless us with her former
                    qualities .</p>
