               <br/> Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies<br/> In
                    motion of no less celerity<br/> Than that of thought . Suppose that you have
                    seen<br/> The well-appointed king at Dover pier<br/> Embark his royalty , and
                    his brave fleet<br/> With silken streamers the young Phoebus<br/> fanning
                    .<br/> Play with your fancies and in them behold ,<br/> Upon the hempen tackle
                    , shipboys climbing .<br/> Hear the shrill whistle , which doth order
                    give<br/> To sounds confused . Behold the threaden sails ,<br/> Borne with
                    th’ invisible and creeping wind ,<br/> Draw the huge bottoms through the
                    furrowed sea ,<br/> Breasting the lofty surge . O , do but think<br/> You
                    stand upon the rivage and behold<br/> A city on th’ inconstant billows
                    dancing ,<br/> For so appears this fleet majestical ,<br/> Holding due course
                    to Harfleur . Follow , follow !<br/> Grapple your minds to <span class="neologism">sternage</span> of this navy ,<br/> And leave your
                    England , as dead midnight still ,<br/> Guarded with grandsires , babies , and
                    old women ,<br/> Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance ,<br/> For
                    who is he whose chin is but enriched<br/> With one appearing hair that will not
                    follow<br/> These culled and choice-drawn cavaliers to France ?<br/> Work ,
                    work your thoughts , and therein see a siege ;<br/> Behold the ordnance on
                    their carriages ,<br/> With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur .<br/>
                    Suppose th’ Ambassador from the French comes<br/> back ,<br/> Tells
                    Harry that the King doth offer him<br/> Katherine his daughter and with her ,
                    to dowry ,<br/> Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms .<br/> The offer likes
                    not , and the nimble gunner<br/> With linstock now the devilish cannon touches ,<br/>
               <br/> And down goes all before them . Still be kind ,<br/> And eke out our
                    performance with your mind .</p>
