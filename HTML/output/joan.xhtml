               <br/> When all aloud the wind doth blow ,<br/> And coughing drowns the
                    parson’s saw ,<br/> And birds sit brooding in the snow ,<br/> And
                    Marian’s nose looks red and raw ;<br/> When roasted crabs hiss in the
                    bowl ,<br/> Then nightly sings the staring owl<br/> Tu-whit to-who . A merry
                    note ,<br/> While greasy <span class="neologism">Joan</span> doth keel the pot
                    .</p>
