               <br/> Indeed , I was their tutor to instruct them .<br/>
                    That <span class="neologism">codding</span> spirit had they from their mother
                    ,<br/> As sure a card as ever won the set ;<br/> That bloody mind I think they
                    learned of me ,<br/> As true a dog as ever fought at head .<br/> Well , let my
                    deeds be witness of my worth .<br/> I trained thy brethren to that guileful
                    hole<br/> Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay .<br/> I wrote the letter
                    that thy father found ,<br/> And hid the gold within that letter mentioned
                    ,<br/> Confederate with the Queen and her two sons .<br/> And what not done
                    that thou hast cause to rue ,<br/> Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it
                    ?<br/> I played the cheater for thy father’s hand ,<br/> And , when I
                    had it , drew myself apart<br/> And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter
                    .<br/> I pried me through the crevice of a wall<br/> When , for his hand , he
                    had his two sons’ heads ,<br/> Beheld his tears , and laughed so
                    heartily<br/> That both mine eyes were rainy like to his .<br/> And when I
                    told the Empress of this sport ,<br/> She sounded almost at my pleasing tale
                    ,<br/> And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses .</p>
