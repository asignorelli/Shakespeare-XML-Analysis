               <br/> Under the cool shade of a sycamore ,<br/> I thought
                    to close mine eyes some half an hour .<br/> When , lo , to interrupt my
                    purposed rest ,<br/> Toward that shade I might behold addressed<br/> The King
                    and his companions . Warily<br/> I stole into a neighbor thicket by ,<br/> And
                    overheard what you shall overhear :<br/> That , by and by , disguised , they
                    will be here .<br/> Their herald is a pretty knavish page<br/> That well by
                    heart hath conned his embassage .<br/> Action and accent did they teach him
                    there :<br/> Thus must thou speak , and thus thy body bear .<br/> And ever and
                    anon they made a doubt<br/> Presence majestical would put him out ;<br/> For ,
                    quoth the King , an angel shalt thou see ;<br/> Yet fear not thou , but speak
                    audaciously .<br/> The boy replied An angel is not evil .<br/> I should have
                    feared her had she been a devil .<br/> With that , all laughed and clapped him
                    on the<br/> shoulder ,<br/> Making the bold wag by their praises bolder
                    .<br/> One rubbed his elbow thus , and fleered , and swore<br/> A better
                    speech was never spoke before .<br/> Another with his finger and his thumb
                    ,<br/> Cried <span class="neologism">Via</span> ! We will do ’t , come
                    what will come .<br/> The third he capered and cried All goes well !<br/> The
                    fourth turned on the toe , and down he fell .<br/> With that , they all did
                    tumble on the ground<br/> With such a zealous laughter so profound<br/> That
                    in this spleen ridiculous appears ,<br/> To check their folly , passion’s
                    solemn tears .</p>
