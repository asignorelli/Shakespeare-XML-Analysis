                    grow alone<br/> In thews and bulk , but , as this temple waxes ,<br/> The
                    inward service of the mind and soul<br/> Grows wide withal . Perhaps he loves
                    you now ,<br/> And now no soil nor cautel doth <span class="neologism">besmirch</span>
               <br/> The virtue of his will ; but you must fear ,<br/>
                    His greatness weighed , his will is not his own ,<br/> For he himself is
                    subject to his birth .<br/> He may not , as unvalued persons do ,<br/> Carve
                    for himself , for on his choice depends<br/> The safety and the health of this
                    whole state .<br/> And therefore must his choice be circumscribed<br/> Unto
                    the voice and yielding of that body<br/> Whereof he is the head . Then , if he
                    says he loves<br/> you ,<br/> It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br/>
                    As he in his particular act and place<br/> May give his saying deed , which is
                    no further<br/> Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal .<br/> Then weigh
                    what loss your honor may sustain<br/> If with too credent ear you list his
                    songs<br/> Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open<br/> To his
                    unmastered importunity .<br/> Fear it , Ophelia ; fear it , my dear sister
                    ,<br/> And keep you in the rear of your affection ,<br/> Out of the shot and
                    danger of desire .<br/> The chariest maid is prodigal enough<br/> If she
                    unmask her beauty to the moon .<br/> Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious
                    strokes .<br/> The canker galls the infants of the spring<br/> Too oft before
                    their buttons be disclosed ,<br/> And , in the morn and liquid dew of youth
                    ,<br/> Contagious blastments are most imminent .<br/> Be wary , then ; best
                    safety lies in fear .<br/> Youth to itself rebels , though none else near .</p>
