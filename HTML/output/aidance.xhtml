                    and bloodless ,<br/> Being all descended to the laboring heart ,<br/> Who , in
                    the conflict that it holds with death ,<br/> Attracts the same for <span class="neologism">aidance</span> ’gainst the enemy ,<br/> Which with

                    beautify the cheek again .<br/> But see , his face is black and full of blood
                    ;<br/> His eyeballs further out than when he lived ,<br/> Staring full ghastly
                    , like a strangled man ;<br/> His hair upreared , his nostrils stretched
                    with<br/> struggling ;<br/> His hands abroad displayed , as one that
                    grasped<br/> And tugged for life and was by strength subdued .<br/> Look , on
                    the sheets his hair , you see , is sticking ;<br/> His well-proportioned beard
                    made rough and<br/> rugged ,<br/> Like to the summer’s corn by tempest
                    lodged .<br/> It cannot be but he was murdered here .<br/> The least of all
                    these signs were probable .</p>
