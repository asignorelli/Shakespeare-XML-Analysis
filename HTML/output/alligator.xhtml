                    I’ll be with thee straight .<br/>
               <br/> Well , Juliet , I will lie with thee tonight .<br/> Let’s see for
                    means . O mischief , thou art swift<br/> To enter in the thoughts of desperate
                    men .<br/> I do remember an apothecary<br/> ( And hereabouts he dwells ) which
                    late I noted<br/> In tattered weeds , with overwhelming brows ,<br/> Culling
                    of simples . Meager were his looks .<br/> Sharp misery had worn him to the
                    bones .<br/> And in his needy shop a tortoise hung ,<br/> An <span class="neologism">alligator</span> stuffed , and other skins<br/> Of
                    ill-shaped fishes ; and about his shelves ,<br/> A beggarly account of empty
                    boxes ,<br/> Green earthen pots , bladders , and musty seeds ,<br/> Remnants
                    of packthread , and old cakes of roses<br/> Were thinly scattered to make up a
                    show .<br/> Noting this penury , to myself I said<br/> An if a man did need a
                    poison now ,<br/> Whose sale is present death in Mantua ,<br/> Here lives a
                    caitiff wretch would sell it him .<br/> O , this same thought did but forerun
                    my need ,<br/> And this same needy man must sell it me .<br/> As I remember ,
                    this should be the house .<br/> Being holiday , the beggar’s shop is shut
                    . —<br/> What ho , Apothecary !</p>
