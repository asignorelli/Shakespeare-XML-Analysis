               <br/> Why , as I told thee , ’tis a custom with
                    him<br/> I’ th’ afternoon to sleep . There thou mayst brain him
                    ,<br/> Having first seized his books , or with a log<br/> Batter his skull ,
                    or paunch him with a stake ,<br/> Or cut his weasand with thy knife .
                    Remember<br/> First to possess his books , for without them<br/> He’s
                    but a sot , as I am , nor hath not<br/> One spirit to command . They all do
                    hate him<br/> As <span class="neologism">rootedly</span> as I . Burn but his
                    books .<br/> He has brave utensils — for so he calls them —<br/>
                    Which , when he has a house , he’ll deck withal .<br/> And that most
                    deeply to consider is<br/> The beauty of his daughter . He himself<br/> Calls
                    her a nonpareil . I never saw a woman<br/> But only Sycorax my dam and she
                    ;<br/> But she as far surpasseth Sycorax<br/> As great’st does least
                    .</p>
