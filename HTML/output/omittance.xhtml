               <br/> Think not I love him , though I ask for him .<br/>
                    ’Tis but a peevish boy — yet he talks well —<br/> But what
                    care I for words ? Yet words do well<br/> When he that speaks them pleases
                    those that hear .<br/> It is a pretty youth — not very pretty
                    —<br/> But sure he’s proud — and yet his pride becomes<br/>
                    him .<br/> He’ll make a proper man . The best thing in him<br/> Is his
                    complexion ; and faster than his tongue<br/> Did make offense , his eye did
                    heal it up .<br/> He is not very tall — yet for his years he’s tall
                    .<br/> His leg is but so-so — and yet ’tis well .<br/> There was a
                    pretty redness in his lip ,<br/> A little riper and more lusty red<br/> Than
                    that mixed in his cheek : ’twas just the<br/> difference<br/> Betwixt
                    the constant red and mingled damask .<br/> There be some women , Silvius , had
                    they marked<br/> him<br/> In parcels as I did , would have gone near<br/> To
                    fall in love with him ; but for my part<br/> I love him not nor hate him not ;
                    and yet<br/> I have more cause to hate him than to love him .<br/> For what
                    had he to do to chide at me ?<br/> He said mine eyes were black and my hair
                    black ,<br/> And now I am remembered , scorned at me .<br/> I marvel why I
                    answered not again .<br/> But that’s all one : <span class="neologism">omittance</span> is no quittance .<br/> I’ll write to him a very
                    taunting letter ,<br/> And thou shalt bear it . Wilt thou , Silvius ?</p>
