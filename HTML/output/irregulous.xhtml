               <br/> Yes , sir , to Milford Haven . Which is the way
                    ?<br/> I thank you . By yond bush ? Pray , how far thither ?<br/> Ods
                    pittikins , can it be six mile yet ?<br/> I have gone all night . Faith ,
                    I’ll lie down and sleep .<br/>
               <br/> But soft ! No bedfellow ? O gods and goddesses !<br/> These flowers are
                    like the pleasures of the world ,<br/> This bloody man the care on ’t . I
                    hope I dream ,<br/> For so I thought I was a cave-keeper<br/> And cook to
                    honest creatures . But ’tis not so .<br/> ’Twas but a bolt of
                    nothing , shot at nothing ,<br/> Which the brain makes of fumes . Our very
                    eyes<br/> Are sometimes like our judgments , blind . Good faith ,<br/> I
                    tremble still with fear ; but if there be<br/> Yet left in heaven as small a
                    drop of pity<br/> As a wren’s eye , feared gods , a part of it !<br/>
                    The dream’s here still . Even when I wake it is<br/> Without me as within
                    me , not imagined , felt .<br/> A headless man ? The garments of Posthumus
                    ?<br/> I know the shape of ’s leg . This is his hand ,<br/> His foot
                    Mercurial , his Martial thigh ,<br/> The brawns of Hercules ; but his Jovial
                    face —<br/> Murder in heaven ! How ? ’Tis gone . Pisanio ,<br/>
                    All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks ,<br/> And mine to boot , be darted on
                    thee ! Thou ,<br/> Conspired with that <span class="neologism">irregulous</span> devil Cloten ,<br/> Hath here cut off my lord . To write
                    and read<br/> Be henceforth treacherous . Damned Pisanio<br/> Hath with his
                    forgèd letters — damned Pisanio —<br/> From this most bravest
                    vessel of the world<br/> Struck the maintop . O Posthumus , alas ,<br/> Where
                    is thy head ? Where’s that ? Ay me , where’s that ?<br/> Pisanio
                    might have killed thee at the heart<br/> And left this head on . How should
                    this be ? Pisanio ?<br/> ’Tis he and Cloten . Malice and lucre in
                    them<br/> Have laid this woe here . O , ’tis pregnant , pregnant !<br/>
                    The drug he gave me , which he said was precious<br/> And cordial to me , have
                    I not found it<br/> Murd’rous to th’ senses ? That confirms it home
                    .<br/> This is Pisanio’s deed , and Cloten . O ,<br/> Give color to my
                    pale cheek with thy blood ,<br/> That we the horrider may seem to those<br/>
                    Which chance to find us . O my lord ! My lord !</p>
