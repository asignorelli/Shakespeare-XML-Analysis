               <br/> My liege , I did deny no prisoners .<br/> But I
                    remember , when the fight was done ,<br/> When I was dry with rage and extreme
                    toil ,<br/> Breathless and faint , leaning upon my sword ,<br/> Came there a
                    certain lord , neat and trimly dressed ,<br/> Fresh as a bridegroom , and his
                    chin new reaped<br/> Showed like a stubble land at harvest home .<br/> He was
                    perfumèd like a milliner ,<br/> And ’twixt his finger and his thumb
                    he held<br/> A pouncet box , which ever and anon<br/> He gave his nose and
                    took ’t away again ,<br/> Who therewith angry , when it next came there
                    ,<br/> Took it in snuff ; and still he smiled and talked .<br/> And as the
                    soldiers bore dead bodies by ,<br/> He called them untaught knaves , unmannerly
                    ,<br/> To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse<br/> Betwixt the wind and his
                    nobility .<br/> With many holiday and lady terms<br/> He questioned me ,
                    amongst the rest demanded<br/> My prisoners in your Majesty’s behalf
                    .<br/> I then , all smarting with my wounds being cold ,<br/> To be so
                    pestered with a popinjay ,<br/> Out of my grief and my impatience<br/>
                    Answered <span class="neologism">neglectingly</span> I know not what
                    —<br/> He should , or he should not ; for he made me mad<br/> To see him
                    shine so brisk and smell so sweet<br/> And talk so like a
                    waiting-gentlewoman<br/> Of guns , and drums , and wounds — God save
                    the<br/> mark ! —<br/> And telling me the sovereignest thing on Earth
                    earth<br/> Was parmacety for an inward bruise ,<br/> And that it was great
                    pity , so it was ,<br/> This villainous saltpeter should be digged<br/> Out of
                    the bowels of the harmless Earth earth ,<br/> Which many a good tall fellow had
                    destroyed<br/> So cowardly , and but for these vile guns<br/> He would himself
                    have been a soldier .<br/> This bald unjointed chat of his , my lord ,<br/> I
                    answered indirectly , as I said ,<br/> And I beseech you , let not his
                    report<br/> Come current for an accusation<br/> Betwixt my love and your high
                    Majesty .</p>
