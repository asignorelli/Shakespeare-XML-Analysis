            <p class="speech-text">That can I .<br/> At least the whisper goes so : our last
                    king ,<br/> Whose image even but now appeared to us ,<br/> Was , as you know ,
                    by Fortinbras of Norway ,<br/> Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride
                    ,<br/> Dared to the combat ; in which our valiant Hamlet<br/> ( For so this
                    side of our known world esteemed him )<br/> Did slay this Fortinbras , who by a
                    sealed compact ,<br/> Well ratified by law and heraldry ,<br/> Did forfeit ,
                    with his life , all those his lands<br/> Which he stood seized of , to the
                    conqueror .<br/> Against the which a moiety competent<br/> Was gagèd by
                    our king , which had returned<br/> To the inheritance of Fortinbras<br/> Had
                    he been vanquisher , as , by the same <span class="neologism">comart</span>
               <br/> And carriage of the article designed ,<br/> His fell to
                    Hamlet . Now , sir , young Fortinbras ,<br/> Of unimprovèd mettle hot and
                    full ,<br/> Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there<br/> Sharked up a list
                    of lawless resolutes<br/> For food and diet to some enterprise<br/> That hath
                    a stomach in ’t ; which is no other<br/> ( As it doth well appear unto
                    our state )<br/> But to recover of us , by strong hand<br/> And terms <span class="neologism">compulsatory</span> , those foresaid lands<br/> So by his
                    father lost . And this , I take it ,<br/> Is the main motive of our
                    preparations ,<br/> The source of this our watch , and the chief head<br/> Of
                    this posthaste and rummage in the land .</p>
