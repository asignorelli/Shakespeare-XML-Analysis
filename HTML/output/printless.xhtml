               <br/> You elves of hills , brooks , standing lakes , and
                    groves ,<br/> And you that on the sands with <span class="neologism">printless</span> foot<br/> Do chase the ebbing Neptune , and do fly
                    him<br/> When he comes back ; you demi-puppets that<br/> By moonshine do the
                    green sour ringlets make ,<br/> Whereof the ewe not bites ; and you whose
                    pastime<br/> Is to make midnight mushrumps , that rejoice<br/> To hear the
                    solemn curfew ; by whose aid ,<br/> Weak masters though you be , I have
                    bedimmed<br/> The noontide sun , called forth the mutinous winds ,<br/> And
                    ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault<br/> Set roaring war ; to the
                    dread rattling thunder<br/> Have I given fire , and rifted Jove’s stout
                    oak<br/> With his own bolt ; the strong-based promontory<br/> Have I made
                    shake , and by the spurs plucked up<br/> The pine and cedar ; graves at my
                    command<br/> Have waked their sleepers , oped , and let ’em forth<br/>
                    By my so potent art . But this rough magic<br/> I here abjure , and when I have
                    required<br/> Some heavenly music , which even now I do ,<br/>
               <br/> To work mine end upon their senses that<br/> This airy charm is for ,
                    I’ll break my staff ,<br/> Bury it certain fathoms in the earth ,<br/>
                    And deeper than did ever plummet sound<br/> I’ll drown my book .<br/>
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <br/> A solemn air , and the best comforter<br/> To an unsettled fancy , cure
                    thy brains ,<br/> Now useless , boiled within thy skull . There stand ,<br/>
                    For you are spell-stopped . —<br/> Holy Gonzalo , honorable man ,<br/>
                    Mine eyes , e’en sociable to the show of thine ,<br/> Fall fellowly drops
                    . — The charm dissolves apace ,<br/> And as the morning steals upon the
                    night ,<br/> Melting the darkness , so their rising senses<br/> Begin to chase
                    the ignorant fumes that mantle<br/> Their clearer reason . — O good
                    Gonzalo ,<br/> My true preserver and a loyal sir<br/> To him thou
                    follow’st , I will pay thy graces<br/> Home , both in word and deed .
                    — Most cruelly<br/> Didst thou , Alonso , use me and my daughter .<br/>
                    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act . —<br/> Thou art pinched for
                    ’t now , Sebastian . — Flesh and<br/> blood ,<br/> You , brother
                    mine , that entertained ambition ,<br/> Expelled remorse and nature , whom ,
                    with Sebastian ,<br/> Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong ,<br/>
                    Would here have killed your king , I do forgive thee ,<br/> Unnatural though
                    thou art . — Their understanding<br/> Begins to swell , and the
                    approaching tide<br/> Will shortly fill the reasonable shore<br/> That now
                    lies foul and muddy . Not one of them<br/> That yet looks on me , or would know
                    me . — Ariel ,<br/> Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell .<br/>
               <br/> I will <span class="neologism">discase</span> me and myself present<br/>
                    As I was sometime Milan . — Quickly , spirit ,<br/> Thou shalt ere long
                    be free .</p>
