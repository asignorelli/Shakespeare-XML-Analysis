               <br/> This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child<br/>

                    Refusing her grand hests , she did confine thee ,<br/> By help of her more
                    potent ministers<br/> And in her most <span class="neologism">unmitigable</span> rage ,<br/> Into a cloven pine , within which
                    rift<br/> Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain<br/> A dozen years ; within
                    which space she died<br/> And left thee there , where thou didst vent thy
                    groans<br/> As fast as mill wheels strike . Then was this island<br/> ( Save
                    for the son that she did litter here ,<br/> A freckled whelp , hag-born ) not
                    honored with<br/> A human shape .</p>
