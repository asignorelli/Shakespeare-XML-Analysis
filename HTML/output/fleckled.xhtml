               <br/> The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night
                    ,<br/> Check’ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light ,<br/> And
                        <span class="neologism">fleckled</span> darkness like a drunkard reels<br/>
                    From forth day’s path and Titan’s fiery wheels .<br/> Now , ere the
                    sun advance his burning eye ,<br/> The day to cheer and night’s dank dew
                    to dry ,<br/> I must upfill this osier cage of ours<br/> With baleful weeds
                    and precious-juicèd flowers .<br/> The Earth that’s nature’s
                    mother is her tomb ;<br/> What is her burying grave , that is her womb ;<br/>
                    And from her womb children of divers kind<br/> We sucking on her natural bosom
                    find ,<br/> Many for many virtues excellent ,<br/> None but for some , and yet
                    all different .<br/> O , mickle is the powerful grace that lies<br/> In plants
                    , herbs , stones , and their true qualities .<br/> For naught so vile that on
                    the Earth doth live<br/> But to the Earth some special good doth give ;<br/>
                    Nor aught so good but , strained from that fair use ,<br/> Revolts from true
                    birth , stumbling on abuse .<br/> Virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied
                    ,<br/> And vice sometime by action dignified .<br/>
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <br/> Within the infant rind of this weak flower<br/> Poison hath residence
                    and medicine power :<br/> For this , being smelt , with that part cheers
                    each<br/> part ;<br/> Being tasted , stays all senses with the heart .<br/>
                    Two such opposèd kings encamp them still<br/> In man as well as herbs
                    — grace and rude will ;<br/> And where the worser is predominant ,<br/>
                    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant .</p>
