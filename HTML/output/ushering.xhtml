                    retails his wares<br/> At wakes and wassails , meetings , markets , fairs
                    .<br/> And we that sell by gross , the Lord doth know ,<br/> Have not the
                    grace to grace it with such show .<br/> This gallant pins the wenches on his
                    sleeve .<br/> Had he been Adam , he had tempted Eve .<br/> He can carve too ,
                    and lisp . Why , this is he<br/> That kissed his hand away in courtesy .<br/>
                    This is the ape of form , Monsieur the Nice ,<br/> That , when he plays at
                    tables , chides the dice<br/> In honorable terms . Nay , he can sing<br/> A
                    mean most meanly ; and in <span class="neologism">ushering</span>

                    kiss his feet .<br/> This is the flower that smiles on everyone<br/> To show
                    his teeth as white as whale’s bone ;<br/> And consciences that will not
                    die in debt<br/> Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet .</p>
