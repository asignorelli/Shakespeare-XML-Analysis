Here's some general guidelines for how we are completing this project:

1. First, our corpus is going to be three Shakespeare plays each. These can be accessed in the shakespeares_original folder. Now, if you are going to markup one of these documents, make sure you are using the shakespeare_edit folder and do any edits within that. 
2. Ensure that you are communicating which plays you are marking up and when. This ensures that we don't have merge conflicts.
3. We are going to be performing two distinct regex searches; one for the neoligisms and another for the words he invented a definition for. 
4. Ensure you are using the same regex search and replaces, so we have a unified corpus. Use commments or a text file if you notice a unique pattern or something interesting, make sure to document it so we can use it in our analysis.
